# Dataset Details
In the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rhuebner/human-resources-data-set">Human Resources</a> dataset, each row contains information about each employee working in the company. Each row of employee data contains different information about each individual such as salary, position, status, or other work information, which can be used to analyze or find insights into the reasons why employees leave.

## Project Overviews
After exploring the dataset, we came up with an interesting finding: employee turnover, which was mostly in the manufacturing department. So, we wanted to do a deeper analysis on why the employee turnover rate was higher in this department than in other departments and why employees decided to leave. So, we used Excel to analyze and organize the data and visualize our analysis.
